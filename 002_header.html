		<h1> Schooling in Ekpoma </h1>
			<p> It wasnt a good experience at first because it was the first time i was going far from home,and i was quite young all alone in a strange land. wasnt funny at all to me since i am the shy type. </p>
		<h2> Meeting People </h2>
		       <p> Well since i was all alone i definitely had to mingle with people,starting with my colleagues and people i stayed with. Didnt have to be in my shell for a long period of time because i stayed with people who carried me along in all they did. </p>
		<h3> Relationship </h3> 
		       <p> The first time i entered into a relationship was in ekpoma,and since i was a naive girl he trampled on my self esteem which took a while for me to build it back but thank God i was able to. </p>
		<h4> Making Friends </h4>
		       <p> I made lot of friends while schooling in ekpoma,but unfortunately we couldnt continue the friendship because of some issues. Although i still miss them but i guess its best we go our seperate ways. Well i still have someone special that i got while schooling in ekpoma and she is a friend everyone would want to have and she goes by the name Ebos. I hope i mean alot to her the way she mean to me because i love her to the moon and back. </p>
		<h5> Families </h5>
		       <p> I got in contact with the most wonderful families ever but unfortunately the woman that was like a grandma to me while i was there dies 07th of december 2024,though it still feels like a dream whenever i remember her(Late Mrs Mary Ituah). Continue to rest in peace mummy,we miss you. </p>
		<h6> Leaving </h6>
		       <p> At first i was happy i was rounding up my school and i would finally get to leave ekpoma but as the days became close,i started having second thoughts of me leaving. Well i had to go and right now i would give anything to go back there even if its for a week. </p>
